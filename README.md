so users wil be able to choice which modules theyd be limited to. that data analysis python repl ? then we need to work on user profiles. and we need to fix that mock data stuff to use real api calls, we already have a file for my api keys and we allow user to input their, we even allow multiple api keys to be allowed; why then would we be using mock data . shouldnt be a case where i just place my api keys in the secrets.toml and the app works with apis, i wouldnt need to touch any code once i have my api keys and admins depending on which admin should be able to put in api keys for the app. and this is to be deployed as a real app, maybe on streamlit use of fastapi and docker. for me assigning admin status and user tiers, i should be able to do it on the backend and with ui if i wish, so just like admins i can operate from ui . and admins can do the same, a super admin (or admins) can assign role from ui too but i override all . and like i said i am running from my github repo not my local pc . is nlp not already incorporated in this app, so users can query in even the most complex ways and the app could handle it, even if the queries are in natural languages, so as is what is the expected query format for users. i need real time calls, real time , responses, real time answers to actual question , real time api usage , and web scrape . will charts be exportable. in an altecation , can you use my law module for legal advice, what to do next and how to handle such situation . or if you get sued, also can it work in emergency sinerios , also for health caes like this . in the policies though it need to state that non of it , in any module, is professional advice.


so i dont have a users profile page, i dont have an admin dashboard or admin.py, matter of fact i dont have any admin related files . for admins we need different deparments - customer care, analytics, dev , api manager, management and more and they should be more refined . i think the core of the app is set now, whats left is deployment , users, admins, the busniess part of this , payment method(flutterwave, paypall, and local banks, basically any payment method i choose, id just need to add it ; and any additions like this and other than this should allow me the owner/creator to be able to make additions thriugh the backend, the codes, or the ui , same with admins) not all admins should have total access, split into different necessary departments to make the app fully functional. im building this to scale into an actual corperation. . so i would like to know if the core of the app is done, the main agents and all that; so give me the structure of what that should look like , like all what i should have now for a fully functional app . so the charts should be viewabe in chats (based on rbac) as well as exportable(downloadable) , both based on users tier.
