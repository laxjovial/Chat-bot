so users wil be able to choice which modules theyd be limited to. that data analysis python repl ? then we need to work on user profiles. and we need to fix that mock data stuff to use real api calls, we already have a file for my api keys and we allow user to input their, we even allow multiple api keys to be allowed; why then would we be using mock data . shouldnt be a case where i just place my api keys in the secrets.toml and the app works with apis, i wouldnt need to touch any code once i have my api keys and admins depending on which admin should be able to put in api keys for the app. and this is to be deployed as a real app, maybe on streamlit use of fastapi and docker. for me assigning admin status and user tiers, i should be able to do it on the backend and with ui if i wish, so just like admins i can operate from ui . and admins can do the same, a super admin (or admins) can assign role from ui too but i override all . and like i said i am running from my github repo not my local pc
